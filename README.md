# PHY299-Final-Project
This project was done in my Scientic Modeling and Data Analysis course (PHY299 at the University of Mount Union)
The goal of the project was to understand the basics of Computational Fluid Dyanamics (CFD) concepts by using Python to create visualizations of fluid flow

Included here is the code used to produce the results and a paper written to interpret the results.
